# News Poster

A command line app that scrapes the latest headlines and articles from the BBC news website and gives you the option of
emailing the articles to your email or tweeting the headline to a predefined twitter account. It also gives you the
option to browse the articles inside of the command line.

This is built on top of some code I wrote in this [respository](https://github.com/BenjaminRedhead/TwitBot), an
unfinished project where the goal was to build a twitter bot which uses the ChatGPT API to summarise the currently
trending topics.
